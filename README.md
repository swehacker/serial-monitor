# serial-monitor
A little more advanced Serial Terminal like the one used by Arduino dev.
I love the simplicity of the Arduino Serial Monitor but wanted a few changes like command history so I don't have to type in the same commands that has been used before and the abillity to see what commands I have sent in the "log" window.
